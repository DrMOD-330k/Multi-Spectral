# Introduction
We introduce the firstlarge-scale, challenging dataset named DrMOD. This dataset consists of 14,041 multispectral images, each with eight spectral channels and a spatial resolution of 1200 x 900. It spans eight object categories and includes 330,191 rotated bounding boxes. DrMOD covers a diverse range of urban scenes from drone perspectives, addressing challenges such as small-sized objects and complex backgrounds.
