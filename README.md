# Introduction
We introduce the first large-scale challenging dataset, named DrMOD. This dataset consists of 14,041 multispectral images, each with eight spectral channels and a spatial resolution of 1200 x 900. It spans eight object categories and includes 330,191 rotated bounding boxes. DrMOD covers a diverse range of urban scenes from drone perspectives, addressing challenges such as small-sized objects and complex backgrounds.

# Acknowledgement
We express our sincere gratitude to the contributors of the [MMRotate](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmrotate) project. The MMRotate codebase provided a solid foundation for our work in multispectral rotated object detection, and its modular design and comprehensive documentation significantly facilitated our research and development process.
